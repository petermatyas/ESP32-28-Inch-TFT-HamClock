# ESP32 HamClock

A **TFT-based ham radio clock & propagation dashboard** for the ESP32.  
It shows **local and UTC time**, **HF/VHF band conditions**, **solar/geomagnetic data**, and **weather info** on a touch-enabled screen.

---

## ✨ Features
- 📺 **TFT Display** — ILI9341 / ILI9488 via **TFT_eSPI** (fast sprites, broad controller support).  
- ⏰ **Dual clocks** — Local time + UTC.  
- 🌤️ **Weather** — OpenWeather API (enter key in web UI).  
- ☀️ **Solar & HF propagation** — Data from [hamqsl.com](https://www.hamqsl.com/).  
- 📡 **Band condition indicators** — Good / Fair / Poor at a glance.  
- 📶 **Easy Wi-Fi setup** — Captive portal AP **`HB9IIUSetup`** on first boot.  
- 🌐 **Web interface** — Configure time labels, colors, banner speed, boot logo; upload custom splash.  
- 🛰️ **Satellite passes** — Track satellites by NORAD id; next passes plus a live "above the horizon now" indicator.
- 💤 **Screensaver mode** — Random pixel animation.  
- 💾 **Persistent settings** — Stored as JSON in SPIFFS.  
- 🔗 **OTA + mDNS** — Update over the air; reach it at **`http://hamclock.local`**.

## 📦 Requirements
- ESP32 (ESP32-S3 recommended for TFT touch projects)  
- TFT compatible with **TFT_eSPI** (ILI9341/ILI9488)  
- OpenWeather API key (optional but recommended)  
- PlatformIO or Arduino IDE

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option A — Web Installer (no compile)
Use your browser to flash the latest build:  
👉 **ESP32 HamClock Web Installer** — https://esp32.hb9iiu.com/  
(Works with Chrome/Edge and any browser supporting WebSerial.)

### Option B — Manual build
1. Clone the repo and open with **PlatformIO** (or Arduino IDE).  
2. Configure **TFT_eSPI** for your panel (ILI9341/ILI9488).  
3. Build & upload firmware to the ESP32.  

---

## ⚙️ First-time Setup
1. **Power on** the device. It starts an AP called **`HB9IIUSetup`**.  
2. **Connect** to the AP and open `192.168.4.1` to enter your Wi-Fi credentials.  
3. After joining your network, access **`http://hamclock.local`**.  
4. In the web UI, **add your OpenWeather API key**, choose colors, labels, banner speed, and (optionally) **upload a custom splash** image.  
5. Done — the clock/propagation panels will update automatically.

## 🛰️ Satellite Passes

A dedicated display page (touch through to page 8) lists the next passes over your
configured location and highlights any satellite that is above the horizon right now.

1. Open **`http://hamclock.local/sat.html`** (also linked from the main settings page).
2. Enter the **NORAD catalogue numbers** you want to follow — the ISS is `25544`.
   Up to 8 satellites are supported. Preset buttons cover the common ham and weather birds.
3. Set the minimum elevation, how many passes to show, and the prediction horizon.

Element sets are downloaded from [Celestrak](https://celestrak.org), cached in SPIFFS and
refreshed every 12 hours by default, so predictions survive a reboot and a short outage.
All orbital mechanics run on the ESP32 — no API key and no per-pass network call.

**On the display:** a green banner means the satellite is above your minimum elevation
and workable right now. Rows in the pass table turn yellow within ten minutes of AOS.

**Limitation:** only near-earth objects are supported (orbital period under 225 minutes).
Geostationary and Molniya satellites need the deep-space SDP4 model, which this firmware
does not implement — such an id is reported as unsupported rather than silently mispredicted.

## 🔧 Configuration Tips
- **Display type**: Ensure your **TFT_eSPI** `User_Setup` matches your panel (ILI9341/ILI9488).  
- **OpenWeather**: Create a free API key, paste it in the web UI.  
- **Band indicators**: Values are derived from hamqsl.com solar/geomagnetic data fetched by the device.  
- **Splash screen**: Upload a PNG via the web UI; it’s stored in SPIFFS along with your settings.

## 🙌 Credits / Inspiration
This project was inspired by the excellent work of **SQ9ZAQ**:  
- **HamQSL XML Parser** — https://github.com/canislupus11/HamQSL-XML-Parser  

Thanks for the idea and the initial approach to parsing and displaying **hamqsl.com** propagation data on small TFTs.  
This project is a ground-up implementation for ESP32 with **TFT_eSPI**, a web-configurable UI, captive portal onboarding, and OTA updates.

## 📝 To-Do
- 📱 Improve web UI layout for **mobile** screens.  

---

## 🧩 Troubleshooting
- **I don’t see the portal `HB9IIUSetup`** — Power cycle; ensure the board isn’t already configured to join your Wi-Fi.  
- **`hamclock.local` doesn’t resolve** — Try the device’s IP from your router; ensure mDNS is supported on your OS/network.  
- **Blank/garbled display** — Reconfirm your **TFT_eSPI** configuration (pins, controller type).  
- **Weather not showing** — Check your OpenWeather API key and network connectivity.
